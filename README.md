# ESS385 Systems Analysis Final Project

This MATLAB project simulates soil water and vegetation dynamics different conditions. 
It includes:

- Soil water and plant biomass modeling
- Randomized daily precipitation
- Visualization of water, vegetation, and precipitation dynamics

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2023a or later
- No additional toolboxes required

## Usage

1. Open `/code` in this repository and look for the the four different scripts.
2. Run the scripts to simulate dynamics and generate plots.
3. Optional: Adjust system parameters and simulation settings inside the script.
